#CSV Reader

* This project is an example of the remaining API that reads a file as CSV and returns a List with results.
* Samples files are present on resource folder <b>people.csv and people.txt</b>
* Simply install the maven dependencies with <b>mvn clean install</b> run <b>CsvreaderApplication</b> and be happy!
*In theory, you can use the same strategy to read any standardized date structure from a file, perhaps (for sure) it will be necessary to adapt the structure of the example I did by returning a data with the data from the file.

#Acces API Documentation
